# PARALLAX-WEBSITE
🚀 Just built my first Parallax Website using HTML & CSS! 🎨💻

Scrolling through a webpage shouldn’t be boring—it should be an experience! With parallax scrolling, I’ve created a visually immersive design where background and foreground elements move at different speeds, adding depth and engagement.

This project helped me refine my web design skills and experiment with creative layouts. Excited to explore more interactive web experiences!

Would love to hear your thoughts! Feedback is always welcome. 😊
